The ALU Social Network initiative seeks to bridge the communication gap between current ALU students, staffs and alumni.

By establishing an engaging, user-friendly social platform. We aim to foster meaningful connections, enable mentorship opportunities, and enhance the ALU community spirit. This platform will serve as a cornerstone for professional growth, networking, and personal bonds within the ALU family.
